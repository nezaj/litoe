# Litoe

Multiplayer tic-tac-toe ala Instant. [See it live](https://litoe-app.vercel.app)

### Quickstart

```
git clone ...
yarn
make dev
```

Tic-tac-toe should now be in the browswer, and it should work with multiple tabs! Huzzah!

### Motivation

I'm retrying the current Instant experience to see what it's like building a simple app. And [jotting down thoughts](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Litoe-Multiplayer-Tic-Tac-Toe--B3kbUiayio_yskmP1Ga3TuFlAg-s2th3jGLvHEa9qBZxs6G6)
